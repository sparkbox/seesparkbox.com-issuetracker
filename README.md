# seesparkbox.com is a public project!

We've been [really open](building.seesparkbox.com) with the rebuild of our new website. We've finally launched it, and we'd love your help!

We built the site iterativelyâ€”building in layers and pushing frequent releases. We've shared it with the world now, but it isn't perfect. If you see bugs, we'd love your help in logging them here.

If you're comfortable with Github issues, feel free to log the bugs you see in [this repo's issue tracker](https://github.com/neilrenicker/seesparkbox.com-issuetracker/issues). We'll respond, and then mark them closed once they are fixed.

Please provide:

* the browser in which you're seeing the bug: OS version and browser version
* a screenshot of the bug

Thanks so much!
