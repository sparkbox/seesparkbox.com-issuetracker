# seesparkbox.com is a public project!

We've been [really open](http://building.seesparkbox.com) about the rebuild of our new website. We've finally launched it, and we'd love your help as we refine.

We built the site iterativelyâ€”-building in layers and pushing frequent releases--and we plan to keep working on the site that way.

If you're comfortable with Github issues, feel free to log the bugs you see in [this repo's issue tracker](https://github.com/sparkbox/seesparkbox.com-issuetracker/issues). We'll move them into our internal repo and respond to you to let you know when we've done that.

To help us, please provide:

* the browser in which you're seeing the bug: OS version and browser version
* a screenshot of the bug

Thanks so much!
